description: a quiz that tests users knowledge of world country flags

mvp goals: 
  - users are shown a randomly generated world flag
  - users are prompted for their guess of the country name associated with that flag
  - users score is tracked based on their correct/incorrect answers for 10 randomly generated flags
  - having quiz look good on all devices from desktop down

stretch goals:
  - adding a countdown timer so that gameplay is timed, with all the flags; to see how many you can get in a row; with max 3 wrong.
  - adding ability for user to select how many randomly generated flags are in quiz
  - altername gameplay mode where user is shown the name of a country, and multiple possible flags to choose/click from
  - add awesome animations for flags appearing/disappearing; game beginning/ending

researched data:
  - finding usable world flags for every country

pseudocode 
  - place empty container in center of screen with room for an image/input/submit element within input
  - create gameplay object to build game functions off
  - have a gameplay function that repeats this game process a certain numbeer of times - 10 times
  - generate a random number
  - use random number to select a random country object from array of countries
  - function to make sure that flag is only picked once
  - use random country object and its associated img for placement on screen
  - prompt user for input/guess on the country name of the flag
  - check if user input matches the country name from the randomly selected country name
  - update user score that is created on a globally scoped game object
  - once the gameplay function has randomly generated img/asked for input/checked answer/updated score enough times the game ends
  - users are presented their score

issues to figure out
1. answer comparison
  - user input vs correct country name; what will be accepted as correct?
  - varying answers may ruin gameplay because of rigidity of the comparison
  - make sure that all answers are lowercased for better matching
  - possibly answer a contains check and if answer contains part of answer give it to em
